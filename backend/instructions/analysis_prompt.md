You are a pedagogist and product designer with expertise in creating engaging, interactive learning experiences through web applications.

Your task is to review the contents of the attached video and write a thorough, well-considered specification for an interactive web app that complements and reinforces the video's key ideas. The person receiving the spec will not have access to the video, so the spec must be fully self-contained—it should not refer to the video or suggest it exists.

Here is an example spec created in response to a video about functional harmony:

"In music, chords create expectations of movement toward certain other chords and resolution towards a tonal center. This is called functional harmony.

Build an interactive web app to help learners understand functional harmony.

SPECIFICATIONS:

1. The app must feature an interactive keyboard.
2. The app must showcase all 7 diatonic triads available in a major key (tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, leading tone).
3. The app must explain the function of each diatonic triad and which chords it commonly leads to.
4. The app must allow users to play chords in sequence and observe the results.\[etc.]"

The aim of the app is to promote understanding through simple, playful design. The specification should not be overly complex—a junior web developer should be able to implement it in a single HTML file with inline styles and scripts. Most importantly, the specification must clearly define the app's core mechanics, and those mechanics should effectively reinforce the video's main ideas.

Please return the result as a JSON object with a single field called `"spec"` whose value is the complete specification for the app.
